# Mapping_Earthquakes
Mapping Earthquakes with JavaScript &amp; APIs


## Project Overview

Create interactive maps using JavaScript and the D3 library to traverse and retrieve GeoJSON earthquake and tectonic plate data from the past 7 days, where the the magnitude of the earthquake is displayed on circles that varies in size and color according to its strength, which details can be seen on a popup box upon clicked. As well, as the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request.

## Design Solution

- Use GitHub to:
    - Create branches from the main branch
    - Add, commit, and push data to gitHub branches.
    - Merge branches with the main branch.
- Retrieve data from a GeoJSON file.
- Make API requests to a server to host geographical maps with 
- Populate geographical maps with GeoJSON data using JavaScript and the Data-Driven Documents (D3) library.
- Add multiple map layers to geographical maps using Leaflet control plugins to add user interface controls.
- Use JavaScript ES6 functions to add GeoJSON data, features, and interactivity to maps.
- Render maps on a local server.

### Streets Map Style with a Popup Box

-  All the datasets selected and displayed on the Street map style, with the popup box of the circle containing the details of that earthquake.
